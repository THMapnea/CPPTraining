# CPPTraining
Since I was in middle school I was interested in programming and when I was I think around 12 I grabbed as first real programming language c++ after VBA, during my study of software engeenering I am getting the chanche to pick it back up and here I stored a lot of the programs that I made slowly adapting them to my writing style of the time of change in hope that some of them may be of help to someone who wants to get started in the c++ programming language. I am nowhere near 1% or less the knowledge that c++ programmers have so in doing so I Hope to get better and help others do the same too. As stated before there are ten-thousand ways of doing all this algorithm better this are my solutions at the time of writing of the file. Some of this program are at the same level of the one asked in the lecture others get deeper and may not be so much beginner friendly. Since everyone as it's own way of programming, and this is particularly true in c++ if some of the thing that I do might not feel comfortable for you feel free to change them. I will be using libraries in more advanced program so I'am not going to include any namespace, you can delete the std:: and add 'using namespace std;' and the programs should still work fine.
