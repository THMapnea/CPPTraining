Since I was in middle school, I have been interested in programming. When I was around 12, I grabbed my first real programming language, C++, after starting with VBA. During my studies in software engineering, I got the chance to pick it back up. Here, I’ve stored a lot of the programs I’ve made, slowly adapting them to reflect my evolving writing style. My hope is that some of these programs may help someone who wants to get started with C++.

I recognize that I am nowhere near the level of knowledge that many C++ programmers possess. By sharing my work, I aim to improve my skills and assist others in their learning journeys as well.

As previously mentioned, there are countless ways to implement algorithms effectively. The solutions presented here reflect my understanding at the time of writing. Some programs are at the same level as those requested in lectures, while others delve deeper and may not be as beginner-friendly. Since every programmer has their own style, especially in C++, feel free to modify any parts of my code that don’t align with your preferences.

I will be using libraries in more advanced programs, so I’m not going to include any namespaces. You can easily delete the std:: prefix and add using namespace std; to make the programs work seamlessly.

All the libraries project will be mostly compiled in visual studio 2022.

To enhance readability in this repository, I’ve categorized the various topics as follows:

   Basic: Beginner-friendly topics that are essential to know.

   Intermediate: More complex features that can help automate and simplify basic tasks.

   Advanced: Topics focused on optimization, C++ behavior, and specific problem-solving.

It’s important to note that the difficulty levels are determined by the purpose of the topics rather than the complexity of the code itself. While some advanced concepts may not be covered in depth, I believe it’s better to avoid overwhelming beginners with excessive information. I’m aware that there are alternative possibilities and uses for certain objects; for more comprehensive details, you can refer to cppreference.com.

All files related to theoretical concepts offer brief overviews, as presenting every detail of what occurs behind the scenes would be impractical.
